ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chong Hui.

I'm from the Finance Programme (sussfin) at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS).

The reason we're on GitHub is because it is obvious now that technology is indispensible in Finance,
ðŸ‘€ FinTech or otherwise.

This is the space where we explore and share code collaboratively with friends.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: chtan@suss.edu.sg
